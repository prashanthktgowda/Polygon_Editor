# Polygon Editor - Three.js Application

## Overview

The **Polygon Editor** is an interactive web application that allows users to create and manipulate 2D polygons within a 3D environment using the Three.js JavaScript library. Users can draw polygons, duplicate them, and freely place them on a grid-based ground plane. This tool is designed for educational and professional use, providing a clean, user-friendly interface for creating and interacting with polygons in a 3D space.

## Key Features

- **Polygon Drawing**: 
  - Add vertices by clicking on the ground plane.
  - Complete polygons by clicking the "Complete Shape" button.
  - Polygons are filled with a semi-transparent color and outlined with visible edges.
  
- **Polygon Duplication**:
  - Duplicate the current polygon using the "Copy Polygon" button.
  - Drag the duplicated polygon to position it anywhere on the grid.
  
- **Reset Canvas**:
  - Reset the entire scene with the "Reset Canvas" button.
  
- **User Feedback**:
  - Real-time status updates displayed at the top of the screen (e.g., "Point added", "Polygon completed").

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: JavaScript library for 3D rendering.
- **HTML5**: Markup language used for page structure.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the core functionality and interactivity.

## Getting Started

To run the Polygon Editor locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prashanthktgowda/Polygon_Editor.git
Open the project:

Navigate to the Polygon_Editor directory and open the index.html file in a modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).
Interact with the editor:

Click on the ground plane to add vertices and create polygons.
Click "Complete Shape" to finish a polygon.
Duplicate polygons by clicking "Copy Polygon" and dragging them to a new position.
Use "Reset Canvas" to clear the scene.

Future Enhancements
Undo/Redo Functionality: Allow users to undo or redo actions for more flexible editing.
Polygon Editing: Enable editing of existing polygons by moving vertices or adding new ones.
Export/Import Polygons: Allow users to export polygons as JSON files and import them for further modification.
3D Extrusion: Support 3D extrusion of polygons for creating more complex shapes.
